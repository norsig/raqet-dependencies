Currently debian includes an old version of libiscsi.

This source package can be used to upgrade to the version used bij the
raqet server.

Possibly, but not tested the version for the upcomming Xenial release
can also be used:

Please do not clone this git repo, I will regularly clean it or force
push new binaries.
